Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI Project)
Tools Used: Power BI, Excel, DAX, Power Query

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize the sales performance of Amazon products based on category, pricing, ratings, and availability.

Cleaned and transformed raw Excel data using Power Query to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis.

Created DAX measures to calculate Total Revenue, Average Rating, Review Count, and Product Availability Rate.

Designed dynamic visuals (bar charts, slicers, cards) to highlight top-performing product categories and identify trends in customer reviews and ratings.

Implemented interactive filtering and drill-down features for detailed analysis across different product categories and pricing tiers.

Outcome:

Identified top 5 best-selling and highest-rated product categories, helping to recognize key revenue drivers.

Discovered that products with a rating above 4.5 and more than 1,000 reviews had significantly higher sales performance.

Highlighted that out-of-stock products in high-demand categories were limiting potential revenue, suggesting opportunities for inventory optimization.

Delivered a ready-to-share dashboard that can be used by stakeholders for ongoing performance tracking and strategic product planning.
